            <h1>Project Overview</h1>
            <p>TeamVan is where I have done my co-op for my final term. One of my tasks was to re-design their website.
                This is a duration that spanned in three weeks.
                TeamVan Outsourcing is located on West Vancouver and is a company that helps other businesses by
                providing call
                center services in multiple languages and managing various operations efficiently.

            <h1>01 Goal</h1>
            <p>
                I have used the platform GoHighLevel to build the website,
                I also did more research about the company TeamVan to be able to know more and what I will plan to do. I
                made sure to make a progress report to the host at the end of each day.
                I also used Notion to easily track my progress and for the host to see the list/tasks I have done.

        <div class="content">
            <h1>02 Design Process</h1>

            <p>I collected all the necessary files such as a copy of the logo. I also
                made a moodboard that consists of modern, and minimalistic look. The logo was already provided, but
                I did change the colour palette for consistency, I decided to make an inspiration from the old website
                and make a new colour palette from it.

            <h1>03 Development Process</h1>
            <br>
            <p>The redesign focused on enhancing the look and user interface to make it easier for users or their
                clients to explore
                and access the business's list of services. I decided to make it minimalistic and modern as this is a
                professional business, ensuring that the
                users will be able to easily navigate throughout the pages and book an appointment by adding a booking
                system. <br>
                <br>
                I also was assigned to make a funnel website, I made sure to add a pop up for the funnel page and a call
                to action button that leads to the main website. I made a step-by-step pages to help them buy a service
                for a discounted price.

            <p>
                Creating the website helped me gain a deep understanding in GoHighLevel platform and being able to
                explore more of its features
                such as plug-ins and integration. This was my first time using the said platform before I entered my
                inetrnship for TeamVan. GoHighLevel is quite beneficial and easy to use
                as they can also integrate their social media to be able to receive and respond messages from different
                social medias in one platform and connect with Google account
                for booking system.
