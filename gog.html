            <h1>Project Overview</h1>
            <p>
                GOG is a charity that is hosted by a group of friends who joined together to make the people in
                Vancouver's Christmas memorable and joyful. They sell donuts during Winter season and all profits they
                will be using it to give and gift on Christmas. They usually giveaway foods like donuts, clothings, and
                more. This event is personally hosted by one of my COO's and I asked if I can develop the website for
                them to be able to gather more volunteer and donations. This website will be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

            <h1>01 Brainstorming</h1>
            <p>
                Throughout three weeks, as a developer and designer. I listed out a sitemap and moodboard first to
                show it to the client and give them an initial idea what the website will look like. I also have done
                research and list out things needed in the website. Firstly, I made the wireframes so we can make
                changes before the development process. Then after, I started out developing the website. </p>

            <h1>02 Design Process</h1>

            <p>There already is a logo therefore I do not need to design for one but I made an inspiration from the
                colour of the logo they made to make a colour theme and typography. The logo they made is vibrant and
                bubbly which then I decided to make a sitemap and moodboard based from it, something that will make the
                website look fun by the colours and where the user will feel comfort. </p>

            <h1>03 Development Process</h1>
            <br>
            <p> I focused on building a responsive, user-friendly platform using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. I planned to
                make the users be clarified easily about what the website is about and make the donation process as
                smooth as possible.
                One of the challenges I have encountered was implementing a "Donate" button, as it required both ease of
                use and flexibility for the charity. After exploring various options, I decided to use Squarespace and a
                Google Form to offer a simple and secure way for users to make donations or join as a volunteer.
               <br> <br>
                Aside from errors, donation process was another challenge as the client did not provide the
                necessary information (banking details for donation) before the deadline. Despite this, I focused on creating a solid structure and
                design for the website, ensuring that donation could be easily added later without affecting the overall
                layout and user experience. </p>

            <h1> Project Insight</h1>
            <p>
                This website helped my experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and being able to connect and integrate with social media for latest news, JotForm for volunteer applications, and Squarespace
                for donations.
