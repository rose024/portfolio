            <h3>About TeamVan</h3>
            <p>TeamVan is where I have done my co-op duration for three months. They asked for me to re-design their website. <br>
            TeamVan Outsourcing is located on West Vancouver and is a company that helps other businesses by providing call 
            center services in multiple languages and managing various operations efficiently.

        <h1><br>The Process</h1>
        <p>
            For the duration of three weeks, I made a new website for TeamVan. This is a solo project, with the COO giving and helping out with
            the guidelines and for any changes needed to be done along the way. I have used the platform GoHighLevel to build the website,
            I also did more research about the company TeamVan to be able to know more what I will plan to do. I made sure to make a progress report to the host at the end of the day.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>UI/UX Design</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I collected first all the necessary files such as a copy of the logo.. I also 
            made a moodboard which consists of modern, ethical, and minimalistic. The logo is fine as is and they did not request for
            any new changes for the logo but I did clarify with them the colour theme, I decided to make an inspiration from the old website 
            and make a new colour theme from it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <br>
        <p> With the role of a Web Developer, I started out with the index page. During the process, I have faced trials and errors however it is 
            all worth it as I liked the end process and so does my host/clients. They like how everything is now consistent and their clients
        will be able to access the website easier. The redesign focused on enhancing the user interface   and make it easier for users to explore
         and access the business's range of services."</p>
