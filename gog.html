            <h3>About Gift of Gratitude </h3>
            <p> GOG is a charity that is hosted by a group of friends who joined together to make the people in
                Vancouver's Christmas memorable
                and joyful. They sell donuts during Winter season and all profits they will be using it to give and gift
                on Christmas. They usually giveaway
                foods like donuts, clothings, and more. This event is personally hosted by one of my COO's and I asked
                if I can develop the website
                for them to be able to gather more volunteer and donations.

        <h1><br>The Process</h1>
        <p>
            Throughout three weeks, as a solo developer and designer. I listed out a sitemap and moodboard first to show
            it to the client and give them an initial
            idea what the website will look like. I also have done research and list out things needed in the website.
            Firstly, I made the wireframes so
            we can make changes before the development process. Then after, I started out developing the website.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Design Process </h2>
        <br>
        <p> My COO's friend has already designed a logo therefore I made an inspiration from the colour of the logo they
            made to make a colour theme and typography.
            The logo they made is vibrant and bubbly which then I decided to make a sitemap and moodboard based from it,
            something that will look like fun
            and where the user will feel comfort.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            I focused on building a responsive, user-friendly platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I planned to
            make the users be clarified easily about what the website is about and make the donation process as smooth
            as possible.

            <br>

            One of the challenges I have encountered was implementing a "Donate" button, as it required both ease of use
            and flexibility for the charity. After exploring various options, I decided to use Squarespace and a Google
            Form to offer a simple and secure way for users to make donations or join as a volunteer.

            <br>
            Aside from errors, content development was another challenge as the client did not provided the necessary
            information before the deadline. Despite this, I focused on creating a solid structure and design for the
            website, ensuring that content could be easily added later without affecting the overall layout and user
            experience.
