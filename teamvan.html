            <p>TeamVan is where I have done my co-op for my final term. One of my tasks was to re-design their website. This is a duration that spanned in three weeks.
                TeamVan Outsourcing is located on West Vancouver and is a company that helps other businesses by
                providing call
                center services in multiple languages and managing various operations efficiently.

            <p>
                This is a solo project, with the COO giving and helping
                out with
                the guidelines and for any changes needed to be done along the way. I have used the platform GoHighLevel
                to build the website,
                I also did more research about the company TeamVan to be able to know more what I will plan to do. I
                made sure to make a progress report to the host at the end of the day.
                I also used Notion to easily track my progress and for the host to see the list/tasks I have done.

            <h1>UI/UX Design Process</h1>
        
            <p>I collected first all the necessary files such as a copy of the logo. I also
                made a moodboard which consists of modern, ethical, and minimalistic. The logo did not need any changes
                but I did change the colour theme for consistency, I decided to make an inspiration from the old website
                and make a new colour theme from it.

            <h1>Development Process</h1>
            <br>
            <p> With the role of a Web Developer, I started out with the index page. During the process, I have faced
                trials and errors however it is
                all worth it as I liked the end process and so does my host/clients. The redesign focused on enhancing
                the user interface and to make it easier for users or their clients to explore
                and access the business's list of services. I decided to make it minimalistic and modern as this is a
                professional business, ensuring that the
                users will be able to easily navigate throughout the pages and book by adding a booking system. <br>
                <br>
                I also was assigned to make a funnel website, I made sure to add a pop up for the funnel page and a call
                to action button that leads to the main website. I made a step-by-step pages to help them buy a service 
                for a discounted price.
